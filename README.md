I am Wagner Cotta, an engineer that loves system and software development since the age of 13, when began a continuous and self-taught journey into programming.
Being dedicated, tenacious, and self-critical, I have been working in the IT area since 2011, when I still was an undergraduate student. 
This journey has allowed me to accumulate valuable experience and knowledge in many concepts and technologies, methodologies, programming languages, systems, and tools, such as:

- Waterfall, Agile, DevOps
- Computer networking, Distributed systems, Message Brokers
- Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, Git
- Python, C, C++, C#, Java
- FastAPI, Vue, PHP, Javascript, HTML

and many others.

For the past four years, I have been contributing to a variety of projects by developing intelligent systems and applying artificial intelligence in the robotics field.</h3>
